## What's Been Done

With archival research and online resources, this project aims to place D'Angelo's writings within the wider narrative of Italian-American literature, immigration, and labour of the early 20th century. Future plans to expand this research through stronger engagement with New York and Introdacqua literary and historical groups, going deeper into the collective story that D’Angelo illustrates

Research has mainly involved reading D'Angelo's writings against the backdrop of the Italian-American working-class experience, analyzing how this poetry was used as a tool of resistance and cultural expression. I have learned from D’Angelo’s works about the recurring themes of resilience, displacement, and artistic yearning. Using municipal documents, union trends, and newspapers, like The Brooklyn Eagle, to put his poetry into context. All these documents point to a main defining characteristic of the time, the struggle immigrants faced both in work that was brutal and in a society that wanted assimilation.

The archival study has been important in rediscovering his work's reception, especially through literary reviews and correspondence between him and prominent figures like Carl Van Doren. Moreover, Italian-language-based publications served to give a stronger cultural hold to immigrants, especially through Italian Newspapers found spread throughout America.

## Future Reseach

In order to expand this work done here, there is a plan and hopes to research further and work together with others. With hopes to work with historical societies, literary organizations, and archive centers based in New York and Introdacqua. Researchers and community organizations dedicated to Italian-American literature can help increase accessibility to unpublished text, documents, letters, and even oral histories missing from this exhibit. All allowing for a deeper understanding of D’Angelo’s life, his works, and his cultural contexts. 

Some broader future research may include a more in-depth study on Italian-language and labour newspapers like “L'Adunata dei Refrattari”, which may shed light on how much revolutionary labour movements influenced D'Angelo and his associates. Also, focusing more on the period later in his life (and during his eventual death), the Great Depression and how even more significant economic and labour struggles impacted the lives and works of these immigrant-labour poets.

Overall, by connecting literary criticism to historical inquiry, this project will reveal the role of poetry as a force of cultural and labour resistance within immigrant communities. With hopes to further revive interest in the voices of Italian-American workers whose creative labours have been silenced for so long by prevailing narratives.

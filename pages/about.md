## Description 
The early 20th century witnessed one of the largest waves of immigration to the United States of America. Between the late 19th and the early 20th century, over four million Italians arrived in America, abandoning economic instability, political repression, and regional disparity. However, as Italians arrived, they faced new narratives of hardship, labour, and assimilation. The story of these immigrants stresses the cultural resilience of the Italian immigrants themselves as political agents in social movements, community organizing, and the arts. Fighting to deconstruct the stereotype of the poor Italian immigrant who hardly struggled to live as a labourer; instead, Italian immigrants became leaders in American culture and construction.

Yet, in this larger frame, the voice of Italian immigrants has often remained suppressed. Specifically, early 20th-century Italian-American writing, poetry most of all, was fighting to be heard throughout the country. The life and works of Pascal D’Angelo (1894-1932) provide a very rare example of a working-class immigrant becoming a published poet with recognition in the most elite American literary circles. His poetry and autobiography, *Son of Italy* (1924), voice the story of Italian immigrants who were silent for so long.

Pascal D’Angelo’s work fills a gap between immigrant labour history and literary expression. Compared with most of his contemporaries had ethnic newspapers and local community publications as their only venues-D’Angelo sought and received literary recognition in mainstream venues like The Nation while eliciting critical acclaim from critics. His poetry allows one to experience the dual nature of the immigrant experience. As he illustrates the idealization of the homeland amid the brutal realities of the immigrants’ new home. Providing accounts that are both very personal and historically relevant regarding the hardships and dreams of Italian immigrants.

This website was created to illuminate D’Angelo’s legacy and the broader significance of Italian-American labor poetry. As a distant relative, I have long been fascinated by his life and the stories of Southern Italian immigrants, whose resilience and cultural contributions are too often overlooked. Through historical research and literary analysis, this project seeks to contextualize D’Angelo’s work within the struggles of early 20th-century Italian immigrants and the larger history of labor activism. His poetry was not just a personal pursuit but part of a wider tradition of working-class artistic expression—one that shaped, and was shaped by, the social and economic conditions of the time.

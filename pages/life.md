## Early Life

Born in the small village of Introdacqua, found confined in the mountains of the region Abruzzo, D’Angelo grew up facing the socio-economic struggles of southern Italy. Introdacqua displays the conditions many faced in the South as the North was becoming more and more industrialized. Poverty grew and many held onto traditional practices of subsistence farming. This setting instilled an appreciation of nature, a feature that was later on evidently carried into D’Angelo’s poetry.

By 16, with his father, Pascal D’Angelo emigrated to the United states. Driven by the economic desperation he faced his whole life in Italy and the fascination of the New World of America. Coming during this period of the early 20th century he was like many southern Italian immigrants and a part of a great wave of mass migration pushed by the industrialization opportunity and the decline of the traditional agrarian practices in Italy. His journey proved to be a turning point in his life, as D’Angelo moved away from the simplicity of mountain life to facing the unforgiving demands of industrial labour. His autobiography, Son of Italy, follows this transition in his life, illustrating through words the psychological and physical toll that had come from leaving his homeland (Son of Italy, 1924, 13–16).

When D’Angelo first came to America he was quickly thrown into the stereotypical pick-and-shovel labour, struggling in railroad construction and other similar grueling jobs. Most of these roles became symbols of the limited options Italian immigrants quickly realized they faced, largely relegated to the bottom of the labour market. These oppressive conditions were what allowed D’Angelo to find solace and inspiration in the English language, something quite uncommon for the lowly immigrant labourer. His determination to master english and write about his own experiences in poetry is what set him apart from most and even other immigrant poets.


## Life in America

Pascal D’Angelo quickly got the nickname of pick-and-shovel poet, with his earliest published poems being The Toilers. His work significantly exposed the conditions of immigrant labour, depicting both the brutality and the unwavering dignity of the workers. These poems became popular with readers as they resonated with and connected to D’Angelo’s work, quickly earning publication alongside giants such as Rudyard Kipling (Barone et al, 2021, 15). His work not only drew attention to the difficulties of immigrant labourers but also revealed their strength and most importantly their humanity.

D’Angelo’s breakthrough came when his poem The Railroad was published in The Nation. This recognition quickly put him into the spotlight, being praised for his work's ability of vivid and heartfelt imagery of the immigrant experience. However, all his literary works and ambitions would culminate with Macmillan’s publication of his autobiography, Son of Italy, in 1924. This book is a mixture of prose and poetry, illustrating his life's journey from enormous struggles through a life of labour to a recognized poet (Son of Italy, 1924, ix–xi). Carl Van Doren, an influential literary critic and historian. Van Doren recognized D’Angelo’s work for its authenticity and artistic abilities, advocating for more acknowledgment of D’Angelo and his art. His support quickly opened the doors to prestigious publishing houses and literary circles, helping solidify D’Angelo’s place in the cultural heritage of this era (Barone, 2024, 4).

D’Angelo’s Poetry is a statement of his double identity; as an Italian and American. His work contrats the rustic beauty of Abruzzo with the industrial brutalness of America, coming together to create the story of the immigrant experience. Poems “Monte Majella” and “Midday” focus on the more pastoral peacefulness of his homeland, while others, like “The City”, depict the alienation and struggles of immigrant life in a loud and industrialized America. (Barone et al, 2021, 16-19). Pascal D’Angelo’s use of lyrical language and vivid imagery allows readers to be immersed into his timeless works, where they could almost touch the emotions core to his experiences. Thus, his poetry serves both as an important piece of personal expression and a historically significant broader commentary on the realities faced by immigrant communities in the early 20th century.

Beyond the literary work itself, D'Angelo's is an important voice, being the representative voice of the Italian immigrant community. These works provide insight to understand the cultural and social dynamics of an early 20th century world, not obtainable through common historical textbooks. Revealing personal push and pull factors of the time, and the struggles and resilience immigrants had as they fought to establish a new life and identity in a new land. Son of Italy continues to be influential text of immigrant literature, one that gives the reader a view of the transformative power of art to overcome struggle. Through the documentation of his life and experiences, D’Angelo preserves his personal story and contributes to the collective memory of Italian immigrant labourers. His poetry also speaks to the great human spirit of the community, which, faced by a host of adversities, managed to leave an indelible mark on American society (Barone et al, 2021, 27).

The life of D’Angelo was, like for most Italian immigrants, full of economic struggle and uncertainty. With few proper opportunities for economic growth or even stability, “By [1932] D’Angelo had pawned his typewriter and could not even afford paper. He continued to write, however, scrawling his poems in the margins of old newspapers, on the backs of calendars, and eventually on the walls of his apartment" (Anbinder, 2016, 388-9). D’Angelo faced psychological and physical stress during work and after work. He died at age 38 in 1932 at Kings County Hospital from what reports state following an appendectomy and destitute. With no money even to pay for a funeral he was buried in Brooklyn's St. John's Cemetery and for the most part forgotten. Post-death publication/re-publications and new scholarly interest into this era of mass immigration secured D’Angelo’s lasting legacy. With his works being praise and studied as important contributions to immigrant and labour literature, revealing the lives, identity and artistic hopes of struggling immigrants of 20th century America (Barone et al, 2021, 4).
